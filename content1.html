        <p>This course covers various topics related to the oceans. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    
        <h2>Module 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p>The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that covers approximately 70% of the Earth's surface.
          It consists of five major ocean basins: the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean.
          The ocean is an interconnected system of water, with varying depths, temperatures, and salinity levels.
          
          </p>
    
        <h2>Module 2: Topic 1</h2>
        <p>The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate by absorbing and storing heat.
          It produces oxygen through photosynthesis by phytoplankton, which is essential for all life on Earth.
          The ocean is a source of food, livelihood, and resources for billions of people around the world.
          It acts as a carbon sink, helping to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and mitigate climate change.
          </p>
    
        <h2>Module 3: Topic 2</h2>
        <p>The ocean is divided into distinct zones based on depth and light penetration, including the sunlight, twilight, and midnight zones.
          Ocean currents and tides are driven by various factors, including wind patterns, the rotation of the Earth, and temperature gradients.
          Coastal areas, where land meets the ocean, are rich in biodiversity and support diverse ecosystems.
